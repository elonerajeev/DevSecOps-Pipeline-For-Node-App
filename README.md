## Introduction

This repository provides a full-fledged DevSecOps pipeline for a Node.js application. It automates code building, testing, security scanning, containerization, and deployment, ensuring rapid and reliable delivery of secure software.

## Features

- Automated CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning (SCA)
- Container security scanning
- Unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
- Linting and code formatting
- Containerization with Docker
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) support
- Deployment to cloud platforms (customizable)
- Secrets management
- Detailed documentation

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Application runtime
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD automation
- **ESLint/Prettier**: Linting and formatting
- **Jest/Mocha**: Testing frameworks
- **OWASP Dependency-Check / npm audit**: Dependency scanning
- **SonarQube / CodeQL**: Static code analysis
- **Trivy / Snyk**: Container and code scanning
- **Docker**: Containerization
- **Terraform/CloudFormation**: (Optional) IaC
- **Secrets Management**: GitHub Secrets or HashiCorp Vault

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 14.x
- Docker
- GitHub account
- (Optional) Cloud provider credentials (AWS, Azure, GCP)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/elonerajeev/DevSecOps-Pipeline-For-Node-App.git
   cd DevSecOps-Pipeline-For-Node-App
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

- Configure environment variables in a `.env` file or via GitHub Secrets.
- Update pipeline configuration files in `.github/workflows/` as needed.
- (Optional) Set up cloud provider credentials for deployment.

### Usage

- **Development:**  
  Start the app locally:
  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

- **Run tests:**  
  ```sh
  npm test
  ```

- **Lint code:**  
  ```sh
  npm run lint
  ```

- **Build Docker image:**  
  ```sh
  docker build -t node-app .
  ```

- **Trigger CI/CD pipeline:**  
  Push code to GitHub; the pipeline will run automatically.

## CI/CD Pipeline Breakdown

### Code Quality & Linting

- Automated linting with ESLint and formatting with Prettier.
- Ensures consistent code style and catches common errors.

### Unit & Integration Tests

- Tests executed via Jest/Mocha.
- Includes coverage reporting.

### Security Scanning

- **SAST:** CodeQL/SonarQube analyze code for vulnerabilities.
- **Dependency Scanning:** `npm audit`, OWASP Dependency-Check scan for vulnerable packages.
- **Container Scan:** Trivy/Snyk scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.

### Dependency Management

- Automated updates using Dependabot (optional).
- Lockfile maintained for reproducibility.

### Containerization & Deployment

- Application is built into a Docker image.
- (Optional) Pushed to a container registry.
- Automated deployment using IaC tools or platform-specific scripts.

## Security Practices

- Use of secrets management for sensitive credentials.
- Automated static and dynamic security checks.
- Minimal base images and least privilege principle in Dockerfiles.
- Regularly updated dependencies.

## Best Practices

- Branch protection and required status checks in GitHub.
- Automated test and security gates.
- Infrastructure as Code for reproducible environments.
- Continuous monitoring and alerting for vulnerabilities.
